```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Summary

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

Today is `r Sys.Date()`


## Code

```{r code, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(plotly)
data("chickwts")
fig <- plot_ly(chickwts, y=~weight, color=~feed, type="box")
fig <- fig %>% layout(title = 'Chicken Weights by Feed Type',
                      xaxis = list(title = 'Feed Type'),
                      yaxis = list(title = 'Weight (g)'))
fig
```

## Plot

```{r plot}
fig
```

## Thanks
