## Summary

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## Map

Today is `r Sys.Date()`

```{r map}
library(leaflet)
map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lat=-22.8184, lng=-47.0647,
             popup="University of Campinas (Unicamp), Brazil")
map
```
